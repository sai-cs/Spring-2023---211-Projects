These projects represent some of the work completed in the 211 course, with a focus on the 8 Queens algorithm. The evolution of these projects demonstrates the progression from basic implementations to more advanced and optimized versions, each incorporating new features or improving upon previous efficiency.

Project Descriptions
1DBQueens.cpp
This project solves the 1-dimensional variant of the 8 Queens problem. It demonstrates a basic understanding and implementation of constraint satisfaction problems in a simpler context.

8Queens.cpp
The classic 8 Queens problem is solved here, where the goal is to place 8 queens on an 8x8 chessboard such that no two queens threaten each other. The solution involves backtracking algorithms.

Dummy8Queens.cpp
An experimental or alternate approach to solving the 8 Queens problem. This may include different heuristics or optimization techniques compared to the primary solution.

EightCross.cpp
This project extends the 8 Queens problem, potentially adding new rules or constraints to the classic challenge. It aims to explore variations and deepen the understanding of the core problem.

StableMariage.cpp
Implements the Stable Marriage problem, which finds a stable matching between two sets of elements based on preferences. This project demonstrates an understanding of algorithmic matching problems and their applications.

fancy8queens.cpp
A more advanced or optimized version of the 8 Queens problem, introducing new constraints or improving the efficiency of the solution.
